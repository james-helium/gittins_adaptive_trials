Supplementary tables and R scripts for the Gittins Adaptive Experiments paper (He, Mavrogonatou &amp; Villar, Computing Conference 2023)

In this repository you can find a PDF copy of the main paper and all the supplementary materials of our paper "Computing the Performance of A New Adaptive Sampling Algorithm Based on The Gittins Index in Experiments with Exponential Rewards". Supplementary materials include the table containing the interpolated Gittins Index values for the exponential reward process, as well as R-scripts of the interpolation and subsequent algorithm implementations, simulations, and visualisations.
